This is our set of science-team facing helper functions for montagu.  It holds things for using the database from R (not the API, which is done by the [montagu](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-r) R client package).

It's possible that there are several things in here but given it's for internal use by a few people we'll see if we can avoid breaking it up prematurely (though if the dependency chain gets too outrageous that may have to happen).

## Bulk data import

Touchstone creation, and duplication, demographic data import, etc

## Burden estimate validation

Until this moves into the api itself

## Administration

Programmatically interact with administration functions not (yet) available in the administration portal

## Reporting help

Helpers for use with montagu-reports
